This is a good offer, but for some, the five free night certificate offer (Up to 50k points each and can be topped up to 65k each) may be a better deal if you have a specific hotel redemption in mind, within a year of getting the certs, as they do expire.</a>

I recall seeing 130k for the no-annuall fe card, 130k+free night for the Surpass, and 180k for the Aspire. It may be worth getting in on this offer now if you just want to get started with it. I like to downgrade to the Surpass or the no-AF card when annual fees come due, then upgrade when they give me a nice offer to do so.</a> <br><font

Do not get the 40k green offer as there's a 60k offer out there right now.</a> <br>

The 125k offer for the reserve is solid if you can use the benefits. For both cards, you can downgrade to the no-AF Freedom Unlimited when the annual fee comes due next year and they refund the second annual fee if you do the downgrade within 30 days of it posting.</a> </li></ul></font></td>

      <ul> - 
        <li><a href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18A/TQNNKVX7LK" style="text-decoration:none">Chase Freedom Unlimited or Flex link, I advise getting the Flex since it has strong rotating categories, cell phone insurance, and the fact that you can convert a Sapphire to the Freedom Unlimited (but not the Flex) to dodge the second year annual fee. The "cashback" earned through these cards is actually in the form of points, so you can transfer them to a Sapphire account and transfer them to travel partners like Hyatt and United for outsized value via sweet spot redemptions</a> </li></ul></td>

        <li><a href="https://mesa.onelink.me/odOT/gge86l53?referral_code=246j2h" style="text-decoration:none">Mesa Homeowner card, if the referral link doesn't attach, put in 246j2h when prompted and we both get 5000 points. Not a lot, but this no-annual-fee card has an awesome "coupon book" of benefits and you earn points on your monthly mortgage payment, no you don't pay with this card, but you link your bank account to show the size of your mortgage payment and it credits you as many points as your mortgage payment was in dollars. If you're house poor, this earns points at an amazing rate. The points are transferrable to partners, my favorite examples are Finnair, which can then transfer to British Airways, which can be used on partner flights like American Airlines.</a>
