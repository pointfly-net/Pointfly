        <li><a href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/18A/TQNNKVX7LK" style="text-decoration:none">Chase Freedom Unlimited or Flex link, I advise getting the Flex since it has strong rotating categories, cell phone insurance, and the fact that you can convert a Sapphire to the Freedom Unlimited to dodge the second year annual fee. The "cashback" earned through these cards is actually in the form of points, so you can actually transfer them to a Sapphire account and transfer them to travel partners like Hyatt and United for outsized value via sweet spot redemptions</a> </li></ul></td>

        <li><a href="https://mesa.onelink.me/odOT/gge86l53?referral_code=246j2h" style="text-decoration:none">Mesa Homeowner card, if the referral link doesn't attach, put in 246j2h when prompted and we both get 5000 points. Not a lot, but this no-annual-fee card has an awesome "coupon book" of benefits and you earn points on your monthly mortgage payment, no you don't pay with this card, but you link your bank account to show the size of your mortgage payment and it credits you as many points as your mortgage payment was in dollars. If you're house poor, this earns points at an amazing rate. The points are transferrable to partners, my favorite examples are Finnair, which can then transfer to British Airways, which can be used on partner flights like American Airlines.</a>
